"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice
without pictures or conversations?",Summarize this paragraph.
"So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.",Summarize this paragraph.
"There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late! when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",Summarize this paragraph.
"In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great
disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well! thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldnt say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house! Which was very likely true.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? I wonder how
many miles Ive fallen by this time? she said aloud. I must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see that would
be four thousand miles down, I think for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over yes, thats about the right distancebut
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Ive got to? Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnt sound at all
the right word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Maam, is this New Zealand or Australia?
and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy _curtseying_ as youre
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it? And what
an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking! No, itll never do
to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. Dinahll miss me very much to-night, I should think!
Dinah was the cat. I hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, Im afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thats
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder? And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? and
sometimes, Do bats eat cats? for, you see, as she couldnt answer
either question, it didnt much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
Now, Dinah, tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat? when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late its getting! She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.",Summarize this paragraph.
"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alices
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway and even if my head would go through, thought
poor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin. For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.",Summarize this paragraph.
"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this
time she found a little bottle on it, which certainly was not here
before, said Alice, and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words DRINK ME, beautifully printed on it in large
letters.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. No, Ill look first, she said,
and see whether its marked _poison_ or not for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.",Summarize this paragraph.
"However, this bottle was _not_ marked poison, so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast, she very soon finished it off.",Summarize this paragraph.

"What a curious feeling! said Alice I must be shutting up like a
telescope.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further
she felt a little nervous about this for it might end, you know,
said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then? And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come, theres no use in crying like that! said Alice to herself,
rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute! She generally
gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it,
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
But its no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two
people! Why, theres hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants. Well, Ill eat it, said
Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door so either way Ill
get into the garden, and I dont care which happens!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way? Which
way?, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",Summarize this paragraph.

"Curiouser and curiouser! cried Alice she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English now Im
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!
for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off. Oh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Im
sure _I_ shant be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut I must be
kind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they wont walk the way I
want to go! Let me see Ill give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. They must
go by the carrier, she thought and how funny itll seem, sending
presents to ones own feet! And how odd the directions will look!",Summarize this paragraph.

     Alices love_.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh dear, what nonsense Im talking!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more
hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like
you, she might well say this, to go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you! But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",Summarize this paragraph.
"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting! Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please,
sir The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if Ive been changed in the night? Let me think was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if Im not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _thats_ the great puzzle! And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im sure Im not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im sure I cant
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _shes_ she, and _Im_ I, andoh dear, how
puzzling it all is! Ill try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven isoh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnt signify lets try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Romeno, _thats_ all wrong, Im certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! Ill try and say _How doth the little_ and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do",Summarize this paragraph.
"How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!",Summarize this paragraph.
"How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, Ive
made up my mind about it if Im Mabel, Ill stay down here! Itll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again, dear!
I shall only look up and say Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, Ill come up if not, Ill stay down
here till Im somebody elsebut, oh dear! cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!",Summarize this paragraph.
"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves while
she was talking. How _can_ I have done that? she thought. I must be
growing small again. She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",Summarize this paragraph.
"That _was_ a narrow escape! said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence and
now for the garden! and she ran with all speed back to the little
door but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than
ever, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare its too bad, that it is!",Summarize this paragraph.
"As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by
railway, she said to herself. Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station. However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I wish I hadnt cried so much! said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk at any rate, theres no harm in trying. So she
began O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse! Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouseof
a mouseto a mousea mouseO mouse! The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Perhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice I daresay its
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened. So she began again Où est ma chatte? which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. Oh, I beg your pardon! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animals feelings. I quite forgot you didnt like
cats.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Not like cats! cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. Would
_you_ like cats if you were me?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone dont be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think youd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to
nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh, I beg your
pardon! cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. We wont talk
about her any more if youd rather not.",Summarize this paragraph.
"We indeed! cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats nasty, low, vulgar things! Dont let me hear the name
again!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I wont indeed! said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. Are youare you fondofof dogs? The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itll fetch things when
you throw them, and itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of thingsI cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats andoh dear! cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
Im afraid Ive offended it again! For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So she called softly after it, Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
wont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them! When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face
was quite pale with passion, Alice thought, and it said in a low
trembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then Ill tell you my
history, and youll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",Summarize this paragraph.
"They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankthe
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The first question of course was, how to get dry again they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am
older than you, and must know better and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.",Summarize this paragraph.
"At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _Ill_ soon make
you dry enough! They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ahem! said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria",Summarize this paragraph.

"I beg your pardon! said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely Did
you speak?",Summarize this paragraph.
Not I! said the Lory hastily.,Summarize this paragraph.

the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable",Summarize this paragraph.
Found _what_? said the Duck.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Found _it_, the Mouse replied rather crossly of course you know
what it means.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I know what it means well enough, when _I_ find a thing, said the
Duck its generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. Williams conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normans How are you getting on now, my dear? it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.",Summarize this paragraph.
"As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to
dry me at all.",Summarize this paragraph.
"In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies",Summarize this paragraph.
"Speak English! said the Eaglet. I dont know the meaning of half
those long words, and, whats more, I dont believe you do either! And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds
tittered audibly.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What _is_ a Caucus-race? said Alice not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it. And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, the exact
shape doesnt matter, it said, and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no One, two, three, and
away, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over! and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won?",Summarize this paragraph.
"This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him, while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, _Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.",Summarize this paragraph.
But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices asked.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Why, _she_, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, Prizes! Prizes!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt water had
not got into it, and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.",Summarize this paragraph.
"But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely. What else have you got in
your pocket? he went on, turning to Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Only a thimble, said Alice sadly.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Hand it over here, said the Dodo.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice, and why
it is you hateC and D, she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Mine is a long and a sad tale! said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It _is_ a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad? And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this",Summarize this paragraph.
"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Let us both
         go to law _I_ will prosecute _you_.Come, Ill take no
         denial We must have a trial For really this morning Ive
         nothing to do. Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.
         Ill be judge, Ill be jury, Said cunning old Fury Ill
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You are not attending! said the Mouse to Alice severely. What are
you thinking of?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I had _not!_ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A knot! said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. Oh, do let me help to undo it!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. You insult me by talking such nonsense!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I didnt mean it! pleaded poor Alice. But youre so easily offended,
you know!",Summarize this paragraph.
The Mouse only growled in reply.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Please come back and finish your story! Alice called after it and
the others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do! but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What a pity it wouldnt stay! sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper! Hold your tongue, Ma! said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do! said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. Shed soon fetch it back!",Summarize this paragraph.
"And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question? said the
Lory.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet
Dinahs our cat. And shes such a capital one for catching mice you
cant think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it!",Summarize this paragraph.
"This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, I really must be getting home the night-air
doesnt suit my throat! and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, Come away, my dears! Its high time you were all in
bed! On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah! she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. Nobody seems to like her, down here, and Im sure shes the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more! And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something and she heard
it muttering to itself The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! Shell get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder? Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now! And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.",Summarize this paragraph.
"He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. How
surprised hell be when he finds out who I am! But Id better take him
his fan and glovesthat is, if I can find them. As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name W. RABBIT, engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.",Summarize this paragraph.
"How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next! And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk! Coming in a minute,
nurse! But Ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out. Only I
dont think, Alice went on, that theyd let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!",Summarize this paragraph.
"By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. I know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink anything so
Ill just see what this bottle does. I do hope itll make me grow large
again, for really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!",Summarize this paragraph.
"It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself Thats quite enoughI hope I shant
grow any moreAs it is, I cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt
drunk quite so much!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasnt
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbit-holeand yetand
yetits rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, Ill write onebut Im grown up now, she added in a
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more _here_.",Summarize this paragraph.
"But then, thought Alice, shall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? Thatll be a comfort, one waynever to be an old womanbut
thenalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnt like _that!_",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, you foolish Alice! she answered herself. How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, theres hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!",Summarize this paragraph.
"And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Mary Ann! Mary Ann! said the voice. Fetch me my gloves this moment!
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alices elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself Then Ill
go round and get in at the window.",Summarize this paragraph.
"_That_ you wont! thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat! Pat! Where are you? And
then a voice she had never heard before, Sure then Im here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Digging for apples, indeed! said the Rabbit angrily. Here! Come and
help me out of _this!_ Sounds of more broken glass.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Now tell me, Pat, whats that in the window?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Sure, its an arm, yer honour! He pronounced it arrum.",Summarize this paragraph.
"An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Sure, it does, yer honour but its an arm for all that.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, its got no business there, at any rate go and take it away!",Summarize this paragraph.
"There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then such as, Sure, I dont like it, yer honour, at all, at
all! Do as I tell you, you coward! and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. What a number
of cucumber-frames there must be! thought Alice. I wonder what
theyll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ Im sure _I_ dont want to stay in here any longer!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together she made out the words Wheres the other
ladder?Why, I hadnt to bring but one Bills got the otherBill!
fetch it here, lad!Here, put em up at this cornerNo, tie em
together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetOh! theyll do
well enough dont be particularHere, Bill! catch hold of this
ropeWill the roof bear?Mind that loose slateOh, its coming down!
Heads below! a loud crashNow, who did that?It was Bill, I
fancyWhos to go down the chimney?Nay, _I_ shant! _You_ do
it!_That_ I wont, then!Bills to go downHere, Bill! the master says
youre to go down the chimney!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh! So Bills got to come down the chimney, has he? said Alice to
herself. Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnt be in
Bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow, to be sure but
I _think_ I can kick a little!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then,
saying to herself This is Bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill!
then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him, you by the hedge! then
silence, and then another confusion of voicesHold up his headBrandy
nowDont choke himHow was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, Thats Bill, thought
Alice, Well, I hardly knowNo more, thank ye Im better nowbut Im
a deal too flustered to tell youall I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!",Summarize this paragraph.
"So you did, old fellow! said the others.",Summarize this paragraph.
"We must burn the house down! said the Rabbits voice and Alice
called out as loud as she could, If you do, Ill set Dinah at you!",Summarize this paragraph.
"There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, I
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyd take the
roof off. After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A barrowful of _what?_ thought Alice but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. Ill put a stop to
this, she said to herself, and shouted out, Youd better not do that
again! which produced another dead silence.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, its sure to make
_some_ change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The first thing Ive got to do, said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.",Summarize this paragraph.
"An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. Poor little
thing! said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And yet what a dear little puppy it was! said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifif Id
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Id nearly forgotten that
Ive got to grow up again! Let me seehow _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great
question is, what?",Summarize this paragraph.
"The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
anything else.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",Summarize this paragraph.
Who are _you?_ said the Caterpillar.,Summarize this paragraph.
"This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, II hardly know, sir, just at presentat least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly. Explain
yourself!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I cant explain _myself_, Im afraid, sir, said Alice, because Im
not myself, you see.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont see, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im afraid I cant put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely,
for I cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It isnt, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, perhaps you havent found it so yet, said Alice but when you
have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day, you knowand then
after that into a butterfly, I should think youll feel it a little
queer, wont you?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Not a bit, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice all I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.",Summarize this paragraph.
You! said the Caterpillar contemptuously. Who are _you?_,Summarize this paragraph.
"Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, I
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.",Summarize this paragraph.
Why? said the Caterpillar.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come back! the Caterpillar called after her. Ive something
important to say!",Summarize this paragraph.
"This sounded promising, certainly Alice turned and came back again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Keep your temper, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Is that all? said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you
think youre changed, do you?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im afraid I am, sir, said Alice I cant remember things as I
usedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together!",Summarize this paragraph.
Cant remember _what_ things? said the Caterpillar.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, Ive tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it all
came different! Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Repeat, _You are old, Father William_, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice folded her hands, and began",Summarize this paragraph.
"You are old, Father William, the young man said,
    And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?",Summarize this paragraph.
"In my youth, Father William replied to his son,
    I feared it might injure the brain
But, now that Im perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door
    Pray, what is the reason of that?",Summarize this paragraph.
"In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
    Allow me to sell you a couple?",Summarize this paragraph.
"You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?",Summarize this paragraph.
"In my youth, said his father, I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
    What made you so awfully clever?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,
    Said his father dont give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or Ill kick you down stairs!",Summarize this paragraph.
"That is not said right, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Not _quite_ right, Im afraid, said Alice, timidly some of the
words have got altered.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.",Summarize this paragraph.
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.,Summarize this paragraph.
What size do you want to be? it asked.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, Im not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied only one
doesnt like changing so often, you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I _dont_ know, said the Caterpillar.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",Summarize this paragraph.
Are you content now? said the Caterpillar.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnt
mind, said Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It is a very good height indeed! said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high.",Summarize this paragraph.
"But Im not used to it! pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily
offended!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Youll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_ thought Alice to
herself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud and in another moment it was out of sight.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And now which is which? she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.",Summarize this paragraph.

"Come, my heads free at last! said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What _can_ all that green stuff be? said Alice. And where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I cant see you?
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",Summarize this paragraph.
"As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.",Summarize this paragraph.
Serpent! screamed the Pigeon.,Summarize this paragraph.
Im _not_ a serpent! said Alice indignantly. Let me alone!,Summarize this paragraph.
"Serpent, I say again! repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, Ive tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I havent the least idea what youre talking about, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ive tried the roots of trees, and Ive tried banks, and Ive tried
hedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her but those
serpents! Theres no pleasing them!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",Summarize this paragraph.
"As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon
but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im very sorry youve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!",Summarize this paragraph.
"But Im _not_ a serpent, I tell you! said Alice. Im aIm a",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well! _What_ are you? said the Pigeon. I can see youre trying to
invent something!",Summarize this paragraph.
"IIm a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A likely story indeed! said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. Ive seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! Youre a serpent and theres
no use denying it. I suppose youll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthful
child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont believe it, said the Pigeon but if they do, why then
theyre a kind of serpent, thats all I can say.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, Youre
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough and what does it matter to
me whether youre a little girl or a serpent?",Summarize this paragraph.
"It matters a good deal to _me_, said Alice hastily but Im not
looking for eggs, as it happens and if I was, I shouldnt want
_yours_ I dont like them raw.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, be off, then! said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. Come, theres half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! Im never sure what Im
going to be, from one minute to another! However, Ive got back to my
right size the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhow
_is_ that to be done, I wonder? As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
Whoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come upon them
_this_ size why, I should frighten them out of their wits! So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",Summarize this paragraph.
"For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet. The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Theres no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for
two reasons. First, because Im on the same side of the door as you
are secondly, because theyre making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you. And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in?",Summarize this paragraph.
"There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on
without attending to her, if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know. He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. But perhaps he cant help it,
she said to herself his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.How am I to get in?
she repeated, aloud.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow",Summarize this paragraph.
"At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footmans head it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",Summarize this paragraph.
"or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.",Summarize this paragraph.
"How am I to get in? asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",Summarize this paragraph.
"_Are_ you to get in at all? said the Footman. Thats the first
question, you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was, no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so. Its really
dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue.
Its enough to drive one crazy!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for
days and days.",Summarize this paragraph.
But what am _I_ to do? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, theres no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately hes
perfectly idiotic! And she opened the door and went in.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup! Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moments pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, why
your cat grins like that?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and thats why. Pig!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again",Summarize this paragraph.
"I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact, I didnt
know that cats _could_ grin.",Summarize this paragraph.
"They all can, said the Duchess and most of em do.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You dont know much, said the Duchess and thats a fact.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the babythe fire-irons came first then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, _please_ mind what youre doing! cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose! as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Which would _not_ be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. Just
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis",Summarize this paragraph.
"Talking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again Twenty-four hours, I _think_ or
is it twelve? I",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, dont bother _me_, said the Duchess I never could abide
figures! And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line",Summarize this paragraph.
"Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.",Summarize this paragraph.
"CHORUS.
In which the cook and the baby joined",Summarize this paragraph.
Wow! wow! wow!,Summarize this paragraph.
"While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words",Summarize this paragraph.
"I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!",Summarize this paragraph.
CHORUS.,Summarize this paragraph.
Wow! wow! wow!,Summarize this paragraph.
"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like! the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
just like a star-fish, thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself, she carried it
out into the open air. If I dont take this child away with me,
thought Alice, theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be
murder to leave it behind? She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time.
Dont grunt, said Alice thats not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. But perhaps it was only
sobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, there were no tears. If youre going to turn into a pig, my dear,
said Alice, seriously, Ill have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now! The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted, it was impossible
to say which, and they went on for some while in silence.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home? when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. If it had grown up, she said to
herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think. And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name however, it only grinned a little
wider. Come, its pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on.
Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",Summarize this paragraph.
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat.",Summarize this paragraph.
I dont much care where said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Then it doesnt matter which way you go, said the Cat.",Summarize this paragraph.
"so long as I get _somewhere_, Alice added as an explanation.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, youre sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk long
enough.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. What sort of people live about here?",Summarize this paragraph.
"In _that_ direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, lives
a Hatter and in _that_ direction, waving the other paw, lives a
March Hare. Visit either you like theyre both mad.",Summarize this paragraph.
"But I dont want to go among mad people, Alice remarked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, you cant help that, said the Cat were all mad here. Im mad.
Youre mad.",Summarize this paragraph.
How do you know Im mad? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldnt have come here.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice didnt think that proved it at all however, she went on And how
do you know that youre mad?",Summarize this paragraph.
"To begin with, said the Cat, a dogs not mad. You grant that?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I suppose so, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, then, the Cat went on, you see, a dog growls when its angry,
and wags its tail when its pleased. Now _I_ growl when Im pleased,
and wag my tail when Im angry. Therefore Im mad.",Summarize this paragraph.
"_I_ call it purring, not growling, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Call it what you like, said the Cat. Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I should like it very much, said Alice, but I havent been invited
yet.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Youll see me there, said the Cat, and vanished.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"By-the-bye, what became of the baby? said the Cat. Id nearly
forgotten to ask.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It turned into a pig, Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. Ive seen hatters before, she
said to herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it
was in March. As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Did you say pig, or fig? said the Cat.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I said pig, replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy.",Summarize this paragraph.
"All right, said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well! Ive often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice but a
grin without a cat! Its the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish Id gone to see the Hatter instead!",Summarize this paragraph.
"There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice only, as its asleep,
I suppose it doesnt mind.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it No room! No room! they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. Theres _plenty_ of room! said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
I dont see any wine, she remarked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"There isnt any, said the March Hare.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said
the March Hare.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I didnt know it was _your_ table, said Alice its laid for a great
many more than three.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some
severity its very rude.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he _said_
was, Why is a raven like a writing-desk?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come, we shall have some fun now! thought Alice. Im glad theyve
begun asking riddles.I believe I can guess that, she added aloud.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it? said
the March Hare.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Exactly so, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then you should say what you mean, the March Hare went on.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I do, Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what I
saythats the same thing, you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Not the same thing a bit! said the Hatter. You might just as well
say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see!",Summarize this paragraph.
"You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that I like what
I get is the same thing as I get what I like!",Summarize this paragraph.
"You might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing
as I sleep when I breathe!",Summarize this paragraph.
"It _is_ the same thing with you, said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasnt much.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Hatter was the first to break the silence. What day of the month
is it? he said, turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice considered a little, and then said The fourth.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Two days wrong! sighed the Hatter. I told you butter wouldnt suit
the works! he added looking angrily at the March Hare.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It was the _best_ butter, the March Hare meekly replied.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled
you shouldnt have put it in with the bread-knife.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, It was the _best_ butter,
you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. What a
funny watch! she remarked. It tells the day of the month, and doesnt
tell what oclock it is!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Why should it? muttered the Hatter. Does _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course not, Alice replied very readily but thats because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Which is just the case with _mine_, said the Hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatters remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. I dont quite
understand you, she said, as politely as she could.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, Of course, of course just what I was going to remark myself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Have you guessed the riddle yet? the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, I give it up, Alice replied whats the answer?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I havent the slightest idea, said the Hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Nor I, said the March Hare.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice sighed wearily. I think you might do something better with the
time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you wouldnt talk
about wasting _it_. Its _him_.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont know what you mean, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course you dont! the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. I dare say you never even spoke to Time!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ah! that accounts for it, said the Hatter. He wont stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oclock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.",Summarize this paragraph.
"That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully but thenI
shouldnt be hungry for it, you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Not at first, perhaps, said the Hatter but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.",Summarize this paragraph.
Is that the way _you_ manage? Alice asked.,Summarize this paragraph.
"The Hatter shook his head mournfully. Not I! he replied. We
quarrelled last Marchjust before _he_ went mad, you know pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare, it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing",Summarize this paragraph.
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what youre at!",Summarize this paragraph.
"You know the song, perhaps?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ive heard something like it, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way",Summarize this paragraph.
"Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle",Summarize this paragraph.
"Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_ and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, Id hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter, when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, Hes murdering the time! Off with his
head!",Summarize this paragraph.
How dreadfully savage! exclaimed Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, he wont
do a thing I ask! Its always six oclock now.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A bright idea came into Alices head. Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here? she asked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, thats it, said the Hatter with a sigh its always tea-time,
and weve no time to wash the things between whiles.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then you keep moving round, I suppose? said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Exactly so, said the Hatter as the things get used up.",Summarize this paragraph.
"But what happens when you come to the beginning again? Alice ventured
to ask.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
Im getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im afraid I dont know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then the Dormouse shall! they both cried. Wake up, Dormouse! And
they pinched it on both sides at once.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. I wasnt asleep, he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice I heard every word you fellows were saying.",Summarize this paragraph.
Tell us a story! said the March Hare.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, please do! pleaded Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or youll be asleep again
before its done.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Once upon a time there were three little sisters, the Dormouse began
in a great hurry and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie and
they lived at the bottom of a well",Summarize this paragraph.
"What did they live on? said Alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.",Summarize this paragraph.
"They lived on treacle, said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.",Summarize this paragraph.
"They couldnt have done that, you know, Alice gently remarked
theyd have been ill.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So they were, said the Dormouse _very_ ill.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ive had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so I cant
take more.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You mean you cant take _less_, said the Hatter its very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Nobody asked _your_ opinion, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
Whos making personal remarks now? the Hatter asked triumphantly.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. Why did they live at the bottom of a well?",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, It was a treacle-well.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Theres no such thing! Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went Sh! sh! and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, If you cant be civil, youd better finish the story for
yourself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, please go on! Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.",Summarize this paragraph.
"One, indeed! said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw,
you know",Summarize this paragraph.
"What did they draw? said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter lets all move one place
on.",Summarize this paragraph.
"He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare
moved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously But I dont understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?",Summarize this paragraph.
"You can draw water out of a water-well, said the Hatter so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-welleh, stupid?",Summarize this paragraph.
"But they were _in_ the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course they were, said the Dormouse well in.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"They were learning to draw, the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of
thingseverything that begins with an M",Summarize this paragraph.
Why with an M? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
Why not? said the March Hare.,Summarize this paragraph.
Alice was silent.,Summarize this paragraph.
"The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessyou know you say
things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Really, now you ask me, said Alice, very much confused, I dont
think",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then you shouldnt talk, said the Hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in
great disgust, and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.",Summarize this paragraph.
"At any rate Ill never go _there_ again! said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. Its the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. Thats very curious! she thought. But
everythings curious today. I think I may as well go in at once. And
in she went.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. Now, Ill manage better this time, she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot
high then she walked down the little passage and _then_she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, Look out now, Five! Dont go splashing paint over me
like that!",Summarize this paragraph.
"I couldnt help it, said Five, in a sulky tone Seven jogged my
elbow.",Summarize this paragraph.
"On which Seven looked up and said, Thats right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!",Summarize this paragraph.
"_Youd_ better not talk! said Five. I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!",Summarize this paragraph.
What for? said the one who had spoken first.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats none of _your_ business, Two! said Seven.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, it _is_ his business! said Five, and Ill tell himit was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun Well, of all the unjust
things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are
painting those roses?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, were doing our best, afore she comes, to At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out The Queen! The Queen! and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions and besides, what would be the use of a
procession, thought she, if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldnt see it? So she stood still where she was,
and waited.",Summarize this paragraph.
"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely Who is this? She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Idiot! said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently and, turning to
Alice, she went on, Whats your name, child?",Summarize this paragraph.
"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very politely
but she added, to herself, Why, theyre only a pack of cards, after
all. I neednt be afraid of them!",Summarize this paragraph.
"And who are _these?_ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.",Summarize this paragraph.
"How should _I_ know? said Alice, surprised at her own courage. Its
no business of _mine_.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed Off with her head! Off",Summarize this paragraph.
"Nonsense! said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said Consider, my
dear she is only a child!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave Turn
them over!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Get up! said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Leave off that! screamed the Queen. You make me giddy. And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, What _have_ you been doing
here?",Summarize this paragraph.
"May it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying",Summarize this paragraph.
"_I_ see! said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
Off with their heads! and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You shant be beheaded! said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.",Summarize this paragraph.
Are their heads off? shouted the Queen.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty! the soldiers shouted
in reply.",Summarize this paragraph.
Thats right! shouted the Queen. Can you play croquet?,Summarize this paragraph.
"The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.",Summarize this paragraph.
Yes! shouted Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Come on, then! roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Itsits a very fine day! said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Very, said Alice wheres the Duchess?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Hush! Hush! said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered Shes under
sentence of execution.",Summarize this paragraph.
What for? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
Did you say What a pity!? the Rabbit asked.,Summarize this paragraph.
"No, I didnt, said Alice I dont think its at all a pity. I said
What for?",Summarize this paragraph.
"She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. Oh, hush! the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said",Summarize this paragraph.
"Get to your places! shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting Off with his head! or Off with her head! about once in a
minute.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
and then, thought she, what would become of me? Theyre dreadfully
fond of beheading people here the great wonder is, that theres any
one left alive!",Summarize this paragraph.
"She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself Its the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk
to.",Summarize this paragraph.
"How are you getting on? said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. Its no use
speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one
of them. In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear
oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at
least, if there are, nobody attends to themand youve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive for instance, theres the
arch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
groundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!",Summarize this paragraph.
How do you like the Queen? said the Cat in a low voice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Not at all, said Alice shes so extremely Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening so she went on,
likely to win, that its hardly worth while finishing the game.",Summarize this paragraph.
The Queen smiled and passed on.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Who _are_ you talking to? said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cats head with great curiosity.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat, said Alice allow me to
introduce it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont like the look of it at all, said the King however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Id rather not, the Cat remarked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Dont be impertinent, said the King, and dont look at me like
that! He got behind Alice as he spoke.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A cat may look at a king, said Alice. Ive read that in some book,
but I dont remember where.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. Off with his head! she said, without even looking round.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ill fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queens voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",Summarize this paragraph.
"By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt
matter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground. So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.",Summarize this paragraph.
"When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The executioners argument was, that you couldnt cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasnt going to begin at _his_ time of life.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about it in
less than no time shed have everybody executed, all round. It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the
Duchess youd better ask _her_ about it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Shes in prison, the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here.
And the executioner went off like an arrow.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You cant think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alices,
and they walked off together.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"When _Im_ a Duchess, she said to herself, not in a very hopeful
tone though, I wont have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes
them bitterandand barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_ then they wouldnt be
so stingy about it, you know",Summarize this paragraph.
"She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. Youre thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I cant
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Perhaps it hasnt one, Alice ventured to remark.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Tut, tut, child! said the Duchess. Everythings got a moral, if only
you can find it. And she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side as
she spoke.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The games going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Tis so, said the Duchess and the moral of that isOh, tis love,
tis love, that makes the world go round!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Somebody said, Alice whispered, that its done by everybody minding
their own business!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ah, well! It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added, and the moral of
_that_ isTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.",Summarize this paragraph.
"How fond she is of finding morals in things! Alice thought to
herself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your waist,
the Duchess said after a pause the reason is, that Im doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?",Summarize this paragraph.
"He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Very true, said the Duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that isBirds of a feather flock together.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Only mustard isnt a bird, Alice remarked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Right, as usual, said the Duchess what a clear way you have of
putting things!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its a mineral, I _think_, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said theres a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that isThe more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, I know! exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, its a vegetable. It doesnt look like one, but it is.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I quite agree with you, said the Duchess and the moral of that
isBe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more
simplyNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I think I should understand that better, Alice said very politely,
if I had it written down but I cant quite follow it as you say it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose, the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said
Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, dont talk about trouble! said the Duchess. I make you a present
of everything Ive said as yet.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A cheap sort of present! thought Alice. Im glad they dont give
birthday presents like that! But she did not venture to say it out
loud.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thinking again? the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ive a right to think, said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Just about as much right, said the Duchess, as pigs have to fly and
the m",Summarize this paragraph.
"But here, to Alices great surprise, the Duchesss voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.",Summarize this paragraph.
"A fine day, your Majesty! the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Now, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Lets go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence, and were
resting in the shade however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moments delay
would cost them their lives.",Summarize this paragraph.
"All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting Off with his head! or Off with
her head! Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, said Alice. I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history,",Summarize this paragraph.
"As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, You are all pardoned. Come, _thats_ a
good thing! she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.",Summarize this paragraph.
"They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. If
you dont know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture. Up, lazy
thing! said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen so she waited.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight then it chuckled. What fun! said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
What _is_ the fun? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Why, _she_, said the Gryphon. Its all her fancy, that they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Everybody says come on! here, thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!",Summarize this paragraph.
"They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. What is his sorrow? she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, Its all
his fancy, that he hasnt got no sorrow, you know. Come on!",Summarize this paragraph.
"So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know your
history, she do.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ill tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone sit
down, both of you, and dont speak a word till Ive finished.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, I dont see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnt begin.
But she waited patiently.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Once, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a real
Turtle.",Summarize this paragraph.
"These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh! from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"When we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtlewe used to call him Tortoise",Summarize this paragraph.
"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnt one? Alice asked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"We called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtle
angrily really you are very dull!",Summarize this paragraph.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question, added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow! Dont be all
day about it! and he went on in these words",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynt believe it",Summarize this paragraph.
I never said I didnt! interrupted Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"You did, said the Mock Turtle.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Hold your tongue! added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.",Summarize this paragraph.
"We had the best of educationsin fact, we went to school every day",Summarize this paragraph.
"_Ive_ been to a day-school, too, said Alice you neednt be so
proud as all that.",Summarize this paragraph.
With extras? asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, said Alice, we learned French and music.",Summarize this paragraph.
And washing? said the Mock Turtle.,Summarize this paragraph.
Certainly not! said Alice indignantly.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Ah! then yours wasnt a really good school, said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
French, music, _and washing_extra.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You couldnt have wanted it much, said Alice living at the bottom
of the sea.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I couldnt afford to learn it. said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. I
only took the regular course.",Summarize this paragraph.
What was that? inquired Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, the Mock Turtle
replied and then the different branches of ArithmeticAmbition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I never heard of Uglification, Alice ventured to say. What is it?",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. What! Never heard of
uglifying! it exclaimed. You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, said Alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, then, the Gryphon went on, if you dont know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography then Drawlingthe Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.",Summarize this paragraph.
What was _that_ like? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, I cant show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said Im too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Hadnt time, said the Gryphon I went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And how many hours a day did you do lessons? said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Ten hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle nine the next, and so
on.",Summarize this paragraph.
What a curious plan! exclaimed Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats the reason theyre called lessons, the Gryphon remarked
because they lessen from day to day.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. Then the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course it was, said the Mock Turtle.",Summarize this paragraph.
And how did you manage on the twelfth? Alice went on eagerly.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone tell her something about the games now.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. Same as if he had a bone in his throat,
said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again",Summarize this paragraph.
"You may not have lived much under the sea I havent, said
Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily, and
said No, never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, indeed, said Alice. What sort of a dance is it?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Why, said the Gryphon, you first form into a line along the
sea-shore",Summarize this paragraph.
"Two lines! cried the Mock Turtle. Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on
then, when youve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way",Summarize this paragraph.
"_That_ generally takes some time, interrupted the Gryphon.",Summarize this paragraph.
you advance twice,Summarize this paragraph.
Each with a lobster as a partner! cried the Gryphon.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course, the Mock Turtle said advance twice, set to partners",Summarize this paragraph.
"change lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the Gryphon.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then, you know, the Mock Turtle went on, you throw the",Summarize this paragraph.
"The lobsters! shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.",Summarize this paragraph.
as far out to sea as you can,Summarize this paragraph.
Swim after them! screamed the Gryphon.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Turn a somersault in the sea! cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.",Summarize this paragraph.
Change lobsters again! yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Back to land again, and thats all the first figure, said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It must be a very pretty dance, said Alice timidly.",Summarize this paragraph.
Would you like to see a little of it? said the Mock Turtle.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Very much indeed, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come, lets try the first figure! said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, _you_ sing, said the Gryphon. Ive forgotten the words.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly",Summarize this paragraph.
"Will you walk a little faster? said a whiting to a snail.
Theres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance?
Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance?",Summarize this paragraph.
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!
But the snail replied Too far, too far! and gave a look askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What matters it how far we go? his scaly friend replied.
There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thank you, its a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last and I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, theyyouve seen them,
of course?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, said Alice, Ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself
hastily.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I dont know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if youve
seen them so often, of course you know what theyre like.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully. They have their tails in
their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Youre wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle crumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths
and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The reason is, said the Gryphon, that they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldnt get them out again. Thats all.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thank you, said Alice, its very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon. Do you
know why its called a whiting?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I never thought about it, said Alice. Why?",Summarize this paragraph.
"_It does the boots and shoes_, the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice was thoroughly puzzled. Does the boots and shoes! she repeated
in a wondering tone.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with? said the Gryphon. I mean, what
makes them so shiny?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. Theyre done with blacking, I believe.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
are done with a whiting. Now you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
And what are they made of? Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently
any shrimp could have told you that.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If Id been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, Id have said to the porpoise, Keep back,
please we dont want _you_ with us!",Summarize this paragraph.
"They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.",Summarize this paragraph.
Wouldnt it really? said Alice in a tone of great surprise.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course not, said the Mock Turtle why, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say With what porpoise?",Summarize this paragraph.
Dont you mean purpose? said Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added Come, lets hear some of _your_ adventures.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning, said
Alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Explain all that, said the Mock Turtle.",Summarize this paragraph.
"No, no! The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an impatient tone
explanations take such a dreadful time.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating _You are old, Father William_, to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said Thats very curious.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It all came different! the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin. He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Stand up and repeat _Tis the voice of the sluggard_, said the
Gryphon.",Summarize this paragraph.
"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!
thought Alice I might as well be at school at once. However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed",Summarize this paragraph.
"Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare,
You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.",Summarize this paragraph.
"later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child, said
the Gryphon.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.",Summarize this paragraph.
"She cant explain it, said the Gryphon hastily. Go on with the next
verse.",Summarize this paragraph.
"But about his toes? the Mock Turtle persisted. How _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its the first position in dancing. Alice said but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently it
begins _I passed by his garden_.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice",Summarize this paragraph.
"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie",Summarize this paragraph.
"later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet",Summarize this paragraph.
"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle
interrupted, if you dont explain it as you go on? Its by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, I think youd better leave off, said the Gryphon and Alice was
only too glad to do so.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? the Gryphon
went on. Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her _Turtle Soup_, will you, old
fellow?",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this",Summarize this paragraph.
"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beauootiful Soooop!
    Beauootiful Soooop!
Soooop of the eeevening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beauootiful Soooop!
    Beauootiful Soooop!
Soooop of the eeevening,
    Beautiful, beautiFUL SOUP!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Chorus again! cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of The trials beginning! was heard in the
distance.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come on! cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.",Summarize this paragraph.
"What trial is it? Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only
answered Come on! and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words",Summarize this paragraph.
"Soooop of the eeevening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd
get the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments!
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. Thats the judge, she said to
herself, because of his great wig.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The judge, by the way, was the King and as he wore his crown over the
wig, look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it, he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",Summarize this paragraph.
"And thats the jury-box, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures,
she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds, I suppose they are the jurors. She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, jury-men
would have done just as well.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. What are
they doing? Alice whispered to the Gryphon. They cant have anything
to put down yet, before the trials begun.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Theyre putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply,
for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Stupid things! Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in the
court! and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down stupid things! on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell
stupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. A nice
muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over! thought Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror it was Bill, the Lizard could not make out
at all what had become of it so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Herald, read the accusation! said the King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Consider your verdict, the King said to the jury.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Not yet, not yet! the Rabbit hastily interrupted. Theres a great
deal to come before that!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Call the first witness, said the King and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness!",Summarize this paragraph.
"The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. I beg pardon, your
Majesty, he began, for bringing these in but I hadnt quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You ought to have finished, said the King. When did you begin?",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was, he said.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Fifteenth, said the March Hare.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Sixteenth, added the Dormouse.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Write that down, the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Take off your hat, the King said to the Hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It isnt mine, said the Hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"_Stolen!_ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation Ive none
of my own. Im a hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Give your evidence, said the King and dont be nervous, or Ill
have you executed on the spot.",Summarize this paragraph.
"This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I wish you wouldnt squeeze so. said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. I can hardly breathe.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I cant help it, said Alice very meekly Im growing.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Youve no right to grow _here_, said the Dormouse.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Dont talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly you know youre growing
too.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse not in
that ridiculous fashion. And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.",Summarize this paragraph.
"All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Give your evidence, the King repeated angrily, or Ill have you
executed, whether youre nervous or not.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im a poor man, your Majesty, the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
and I hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea",Summarize this paragraph.
The twinkling of the _what?_ said the King.,Summarize this paragraph.
"It _began_ with the tea, the Hatter replied.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Of course twinkling begins with a T! said the King sharply. Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im a poor man, the Hatter went on, and most things twinkled after
thatonly the March Hare said",Summarize this paragraph.
I didnt! the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.,Summarize this paragraph.
You did! said the Hatter.,Summarize this paragraph.
I deny it! said the March Hare.,Summarize this paragraph.
"He denies it, said the King leave out that part.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.",Summarize this paragraph.
"After that, continued the Hatter, I cut some more bread-and-butter",Summarize this paragraph.
But what did the Dormouse say? one of the jury asked.,Summarize this paragraph.
"That I cant remember, said the Hatter.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You _must_ remember, remarked the King, or Ill have you executed.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. Im a poor man, your Majesty, he began.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Youre a _very_ poor _speaker_, said the King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Im glad Ive seen that done, thought Alice. Ive so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, There was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court, and I never understood what it meant till now.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If thats all you know about it, you may stand down, continued the
King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"I cant go no lower, said the Hatter Im on the floor, as it is.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then you may _sit_ down, the King replied.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Come, that finished the guinea-pigs! thought Alice. Now we shall get
on better.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Id rather finish my tea, said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You may go, said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.",Summarize this paragraph.
"and just take his head off outside, the Queen added to one of the
officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.",Summarize this paragraph.
Call the next witness! said the King.,Summarize this paragraph.
"The next witness was the Duchesss cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Give your evidence, said the King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Shant, said the cook.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, if I must, I must, the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What are tarts made of?",Summarize this paragraph.
"Pepper, mostly, said the cook.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Collar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out. Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!",Summarize this paragraph.
"For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Never mind! said the King, with an air of great relief. Call the
next witness. And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Really, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, for they
havent got much evidence _yet_, she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name Alice!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Here! cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The trial cannot proceed, said the King in a very grave voice, until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places_all_, he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right not that it signifies much, she
said to herself I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.",Summarize this paragraph.
"As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.",Summarize this paragraph.
What do you know about this business? the King said to Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Nothing, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
Nothing _whatever?_ persisted the King.,Summarize this paragraph.
"Nothing whatever, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats very important, the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted _Un_important, your Majesty means, of course, he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.",Summarize this paragraph.
"_Un_important, of course, I meant, the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,",Summarize this paragraph.
"importantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying
which word sounded best.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Some of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant.
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates
but it doesnt matter a bit, she thought to herself.",Summarize this paragraph.
"At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out Silence! and read out from his book, Rule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.",Summarize this paragraph.
Everybody looked at Alice.,Summarize this paragraph.
"_Im_ not a mile high, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"You are, said the King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Nearly two miles high, added the Queen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Well, I shant go, at any rate, said Alice besides, thats not a
regular rule you invented it just now.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Its the oldest rule in the book, said the King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Then it ought to be Number One, said Alice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. Consider your
verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Theres more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been
picked up.",Summarize this paragraph.
Whats in it? said the Queen.,Summarize this paragraph.
"I havent opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner toto somebody.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It must have been that, said the King, unless it was written to
nobody, which isnt usual, you know.",Summarize this paragraph.
Who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen.,Summarize this paragraph.
"It isnt directed at all, said the White Rabbit in fact, theres
nothing written on the _outside_. He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added It isnt a letter, after all its a set of verses.",Summarize this paragraph.
Are they in the prisoners handwriting? asked another of the jurymen.,Summarize this paragraph.
"No, theyre not, said the White Rabbit, and thats the queerest
thing about it. The jury all looked puzzled.",Summarize this paragraph.
"He must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the King. The jury
all brightened up again.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Please your Majesty, said the Knave, I didnt write it, and they
cant prove I did theres no name signed at the end.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If you didnt sign it, said the King, that only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else youd have signed
your name like an honest man.",Summarize this paragraph.
"There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.",Summarize this paragraph.
"That _proves_ his guilt, said the Queen.",Summarize this paragraph.
"It proves nothing of the sort! said Alice. Why, you dont even know
what theyre about!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Read them, said the King.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty? he asked.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on till you
come to the end then stop.",Summarize this paragraph.
These were the verses the White Rabbit read,Summarize this paragraph.
"They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.",Summarize this paragraph.
"He sent them word I had not gone
    We know it to be true
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?",Summarize this paragraph.
"I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.",Summarize this paragraph.
"My notion was that you had been
    Before she had this fit
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Dont let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet, said the
King, rubbing his hands so now let the jury",Summarize this paragraph.
"If any one of them can explain it, said Alice, she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of
interrupting him, Ill give him sixpence. _I_ dont believe theres
an atom of meaning in it.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The jury all wrote down on their slates, _She_ doesnt believe theres
an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.",Summarize this paragraph.
"If theres no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any. And yet I dont
know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
_said I could not swim_ you cant swim, can you? he added, turning
to the Knave.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The Knave shook his head sadly. Do I look like it? he said. Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.",Summarize this paragraph.
"All right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself _We know it to be true_ thats the jury, of

leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Wake up, Alice dear! said her sister Why, what a long sleep youve
had!",Summarize this paragraph.
"Oh, Ive had such a curious dream! said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It _was_ a curious

So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.",Summarize this paragraph.

"First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyesand still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sisters dream.",Summarize this paragraph.
"The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried bythe
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around itonce more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizards slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.",Summarize this paragraph.
"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queens shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardwhile the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtles heavy sobs.",Summarize this paragraph.
"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.",Summarize this paragraph.
